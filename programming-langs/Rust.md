## Rust
```
Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but provides memory safety without using garbage collection.
```

a steep learning curve tho

## Used it for
- Cryptography Libraries
- Web-Development
- CLI Tools
- Terminal UI(tui.rs)
